# Kubernetes-Lab-Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-Persistent-Volumes-PVs-and-User-Configuration
This repository contains all the configurations and steps I followed in my Kubernetes lab to set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Persistent Volumes (PVs), and user management. 
The goal was to set up a Kubernetes environment where a user (martin) could manage resources in a specific namespace (development), using Persistent Volumes for storage.
This lab helped me improve my skills as a Linux Systems Administrator by exploring Kubernetes, user management, storage configuration, and troubleshooting.
